A website and mobile app designed in a weekend.

This project is designed to help citizens report a crime, find jobs or fill out forms through a web browser or their smartphone.

A bunch of friends and myself designed this app over 3 days and a 48 hour hackathon, with no knowledge of Angular and 3 weeks experiance with HTML and PHP.
